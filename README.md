# C++ Pool

This repository contains solutions and exercises from the 42 C++ Piscine (cpp-pool) program. The C++ Piscine is a comprehensive introduction to modern C++ programming, covering a wide range of topics including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), templates, exceptions, and memory management.

## Overview

The `cpp-pool` is designed to help learners get familiar with the core concepts of C++ and gain hands-on experience through various exercises and projects. Each project or exercise focuses on a different aspect of C++ programming, ranging from basic syntax to more advanced topics such as inheritance, polymorphism, and templates.

The exercises are divided into multiple modules, each one building on top of the previous.

## Projects

The repository includes the following modules and projects:

1. **Module 00**: Introduction to C++ basics, including syntax, I/O, and basic types. (100%)
2. **Module 01**: Memory allocation, references, and pointers. (90%)
3. **Module 02**: Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, and namespaces. (100%)
4. **Module 03**: Inheritance, encapsulation, and the use of abstract classes. (80%)
5. **Module 04**: Dealing with the concepts of subtyping polymorphism and interfaces. (80%)
6. **Module 05**: Exception handling and the concept of error management. (100%)
7. **Module 06**: Casts in C++ (dynamic, static, const, and reinterpret casts). (100%)
8. **Module 07**: Introduction to templates. (100%)
9. **Module 08**: Dealing with templated containers and iterators. (100%)
10. **Module 09** : Containers in C++ STL (Standard Template Library). (100%)

Each module includes a series of exercises or mini-projects to reinforce the concepts learned.

## Requirements

- **C++ Compiler**: You need a C++ compiler supporting at least C++98 to run and compile the projects.
- **Make**: The projects come with a `Makefile` to simplify compilation.
- **42 Coding Style**: The code in this repository follows the 42 coding standards.

## Installation

To get started with the projects locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aitomarabdeljalil/cpp-pool.git
   cd cpp-pool
   ```

2. Navigate to the specific module or project directory you want to work on:
   ```bash
   cd Module_00
   ```

3. Compile the project using the provided `Makefile`:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

## Usage

After compiling the project, you can run the resulting executable. For example:

```bash
./program_name
```

Each module or project may include specific usage instructions, detailed in the relevant directory's README file (if applicable). Be sure to check each module for more details on running and testing the code.
